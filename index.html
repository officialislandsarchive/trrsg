            <h3>May 16, 2020</h3>
            <h4>Update</h4>
            <p>Rolling out a small bug fix patch.</p>
            <p>🗒️ Improve saving for large islands</p>
            <p>☂️ Reduce max factory-dropped items to 40 (still 80 on VIP servers. More info below)</p>
            <p>⛰️ You can now build on the bedrock block</p>
            <p>We've been experiencing major server lag when multiple islands with large factories are in the same server. When too many dropped items exist in the server, the physics will slow to a crawl. This unfortunately ruins the experience for everyone on the server. We're experimenting several ways to solve this problem; for now, we need to lower the item limit to keep servers in a healthy state. VIP servers still have the 80 item limit -- this change only applies to public servers.</p>

            <h3>May 20, 2020</h3>
            <h4>Bug Fixs</h4>
            <p>More bug fixes are going live!</p>
            <p>We've identified an issue where joining a server with a large island (40,000+ blocks) could crash the server if not enough memory is available. This results in the large island's data being corrupted (lots of missing blocks). As a temporary fix, we now deny large islands from joining a server if it will cause a crash. This means players with large islands may need to join several different servers until they are able to load-in.</p>
            <p>We're working on ways we can avoid this type of restriction for large islands. For the time being, players with large islands are recommended to either join non-full servers or reserve a VIP server. We've also lowered the max player count to 22. We're hoping this lowered limit is only temporary.</p>

            <h4>Small Update</h4>
<p>Rolling out a small update! Everyone has been asking for us to focus on bugs for a while so we devoted the past few days to it.</p>
<p>🔧 Island Corruption Fixes</p>
<p>We finally reproduced a common bug that caused island corruption. This patch includes a fix for the issue -- we're hoping this drastically cuts down on the amount of island corruptions.</p>
<p>🛡️ Duping Exploit Patches</p>
<p>We were also able to reproduce several dupes and include patches for them. This should help stabilize the economy to make trading better for everyone.</p>
<p>📰 Island Names</p>
<p>You can now set a display name for your published island. This will show up in the online server list. We're excited to see what type of islands start appearing in the popular list!</p>
<p>🔭 Coming Soon</p>
<p>The team is busy working on a new AI framework that will let us finally add animals to the game! We're also working on an overhaul to the inventory UI -- it includes categories and item searching!</p>
<p>We're also looking for more ways to balance the economy. If you have ideas, please share them on <a href="https://skyblock.nolt.io/">https://skyblock.nolt.io/</a></p>

    <p>New update releasing this Sunday! 🏰🔨🌹🌼</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>October 30, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Game Server Changes</h4>
    <p>Just deployed changes to how our game servers operate. We're still monitoring the changes and are tweaking as needed. A full changelog will be included in Sunday's update.</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Join Codes Feature</h4>
    <p>All players now have join codes! You can share join codes to allow players who aren't your friends to teleport to your server.</p>
    <p>We heard your concerns and are still working on a new invite system... But this should help in the meantime 😊</p>
    <p>Rejoin the game to get access to this new feature. Note: We're still releasing a content update tomorrow morning!</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
    <h4>New Content Update</h4>
    <p>A new content update has been released!</p>

    <p>🌈 Colors</p>
    <p>New clay block colors have been added! Color your clay blocks using the new flowers! There are now 11 colors in total.</p>

    <p>🌻 Flowers</p>
    <p>We've introduced 5 different flower types with lots of color variants (35+ flowers in total). Flowers can now be crossbred to produce new colors. Only fertile flowers can be crossbred (flowers with particles). Crossbreed flowers by placing fertile flowers near each other and watering them. Collecting all flower and color types will take time and strategy! Watering cans also now have infinite water storage.</p>

    <p>🏰 New Hub</p>
    <p>A new castle hub has been added! The Hub now has up to 50 players per-server too! Because there are more players in the Hub, we've made it so anyone who attacks a mob gets a reward (no more kill steals).</p>

    <p>📡 Server Changes</p>
    <p>Each island now has their own server. This was an important overhaul of our system in order to finally increase the build limit. We're still monitoring the performance for a few days -- if successful, we'll increase the build limit to 150,000 blocks (currently 50,000). You should notice that your island loads much quicker now and has less lag in general.</p>

    <p>🗨️ Cross Server Chat</p>
    <p>We've introduced a new cross-server chat system. This means you can chat with players who aren't on your server. This only applies to public Island servers -- hubs and private servers are still local chat.</p>

    <p>More changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔨 Double doors</li>
        <li>🔨 Upside down stairs</li>
        <li>🔨 Top and bottom slabs</li>
        <li>🔨 R to rotate while placing</li>
        <li>💾 Hotbar layout saves on rejoin</li>
        <li>💾 Music toggle saves on rejoin</li>
        <li>🛰️ All players now have access to join codes for free</li>
        <li>🏭 Doubled the lifetime and amount limit of factory-dropped items</li>
        <li>👐 All items render properly in your hand (no more weird cubes)</li>
        <li>🎃 Removed Halloween content</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Flower Crafting Fix</h4>
    <p>Fixed crafting for recipes that include flowers. Rejoin if this was an issue for you!</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 6, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Invite System Update</h4>
    <p>We just shipped a new update that lets you invite players to your island. You're able to invite friends and players connected to your chat room.</p>
    <p>We wanted to release a working version ASAP since many of you have been requesting it. We'll be incrementing on the entire system throughout the following week to make playing with others as easy as possible.</p>
    <p>Also, we're releasing a new content update tomorrow 🎉</p>
    <p>EDIT: Looks like there are a few issues with the new system. We're working on some fixes.</p>
</div>

    <h4>Vending Machine Balancing</h4>
    <p>Vending Machines have become a dangerously effective way to spread duped items and money throughout the game. In an effort to combat this, we're introducing a 10% tax on all Vending Machine transactions. We also took the time to add some QoL features to vending machines.</p>

        <li>💧 Water<br>Water is finally here! Craft empty buckets, fill them up in the Hub lake and place the water on your island.

    <p><strong>Hey everyone,</strong></p>
    <p>Unfortunately, there is still one critical bug in this week's update that has proved challenging to fix. We are still working very hard to get it figured out, but we have decided that it would be best to delay the update until tomorrow. Assuming that the bug is fixed, we plan to release at 11AM PST. It is crucial for us to fix this issue before release as it affects the accessibility of different islands. We have a lot of exciting changes in the update tomorrow and we can't wait for you all to see them!</p>
    <p>Thank you,</p>
    <p><strong>- Islands Team</strong></p>

    <p>
        🌌 INTRODUCING: The Void Isles! 🌌<br>
        A strange rift has appeared in the desert, leading to a shadowy fragmented land referred to as “the Void Isles”… Islands with a mysterious past, shadowed by the very darkness that currently inhabits it… can you uncover the mystery around the demise of the lands once known as Soth’iel?

    <h3>October 15, 2022</h3>
    <p>To clear up any confusion, you need to break the cauldrons if they contain the Scythe, Crossbow, or Trophy. They are temporarily tradelocked and you cannot pick it up normally so break it and you will receive the drops. If anyone asks again, send them to the announcements!</p>

    <h3>October 22, 2022</h3>
    <p>Just FYI breaking cauldrons that have trade-locked items in them with build permissions will no longer give you the items (or break, in general). If you want the items, wait until Nov 5 when you can buy them legitimately. This change was made due to it being a method to scam players + wasn't intended, anyway.</p>
    <p>Yes, you can still break the cauldrons and get the items if you're an owner of the island.</p>

<div class="update-entry">

    <h3>November 6, 2022</h3>
    <p>We are aware of the item delete bug that has been happening as of late and are looking into pushing out a fix for it as soon as we can narrow down the source. It seems to be related to falling to the void while having an item equipped or riding a mount. I'd advise caution of jumping into the void with any of these equipped for now until we find a resolution. We will notify everyone once it has been fixed. We're very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused to many of you.</p>

<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 6, 2022</h3>
    <p>We have pushed out a fix that should have addressed issues with visitors losing items when island owners disconnected. If the last owner of an island leaves, whether through teleporting to another island OR closing Roblox, it should now teleport you back to your island as soon as possible. You shouldn't lose your items through this process anymore.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Introducing a new mini game to Islands for collecting unidentified fossils and rocks. Explore the Wild Islands and collect missing fossils to build your very own fossil statue!</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>🏜️ Fossil Statue 🏜️</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Head to the Desert Isles and speak to the Nomad NPC. You can purchase a T-Rex Fossil Statue from him with Ruby Skorp Scales! Once you have the statue, head back to your island and place it down to show an outline of the T-Rex. Inspect the statue to see the location of all fossils needed to build it!</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>⛏️ Fossil Carving Mini Game ⛏️</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>There are dig sites spread across the Wild Islands identified with a rock pile with pickaxes, bones, and a helmet. The current islands with dig sites are Slime Island, Buffalkor Island, Wizard Island, the Desert Isles, and the Underworld. You will need a pickaxe in your hand in order to play the mini game. When the game starts, here are the rules:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>A bar will pop up with 2 targets on screen (green bar and blue bar).</li>
            <li>The blue bar will move back and forth on screen.</li>

            <li>Miss too many times and the rock breaks, losing the reward.</li>
            <li>Enough successful hits and you will claim whatever is in the rock.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Once you collect the fossil needed for your statue, head back to your island and add the fossil on the statue by interacting with it. (NOTE: You must be an owner to add fossils to the statue.)</li>

    <h3>August 30, 2023</h3>
    <h4>ℹ️ We've discovered the vulnerabilities in Islands for the dupes ℹ️</h4>
    <p>Please be patient while we go through and verify there are no other vectors for attack.</p>
    <p>Once we're satisfied that all potential vectors are accounted for, we will push out the fix & re-enable trading.</p>

    <p>Thank y'all for your patience. Build permissions are still temporarily disabled for the foreseeable future while we monitor the state of the economy.</p>
    <p>There may potentially be residual duped items - If you notice any users dumping large amounts of items or selling items for very cheap below their standard prices, please report the usernames and/or join codes via ⁠No Access (only moderators and devs will see this) - note that this information will be verified by our staff and/or myself.</p>

    <h3>August 30, 2023</h3>
    <h4>🔧 Released the following economic changes due to recent events:</h4>
    <p>Certain rare items now have trade restrictions per day on how much you can sell to vending machines or trade to others (outbound transactions).</p>
    <p>These items will follow the same chest break constraints as trade locked items (non-breakable by anyone but island owners, will show as "restricted" and we will add an icon for this in future.)</p>
    <p>Adjusted the requirements of trading to require all islands levels average to 40 in the meantime (this may be adjusted again in future).</p>
    <p>Permissions are enabled again.</p>
    <p>You may notice the new following section in tooltips of affected items - this means that this is classed as a restricted item by the game.</p>
    <p>Any item with this is limited as mentioned above - this mainly applies to any rarer event-based items.</p>

    <h4>⏰ In-Game Clock ⏰</h4>
    <p>To help track when the day changes, we have added an in-game clock on your island in the top right corner. Here is how it works:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Day will transition at 4:00AM but will officially start at 6:00 AM</li>
        <li>Night will transition at 5:00PM but will officially start at 6:00 PM</li>
        <li>Night lasts quicker so the clock will speed up normally</li>

        <li>Thank you for making Islands awesome 🏝️</li>
