            <h4>Update</h4>
            <p>Rolling out a small bug fix patch.</p>
            <p>🗒️ Improve saving for large islands</p>
            <p>☂️ Reduce max factory-dropped items to 40 (still 80 on VIP servers. More info below)</p>
            <p>⛰️ You can now build on the bedrock block</p>
            <p>We've been experiencing major server lag when multiple islands with large factories are in the same server. When too many dropped items exist in the server, the physics will slow to a crawl. This unfortunately ruins the experience for everyone on the server. We're experimenting several ways to solve this problem; for now, we need to lower the item limit to keep servers in a healthy state. VIP servers still have the 80 item limit -- this change only applies to public servers.</p>

            <h3>May 20, 2020</h3>
            <h4>Bug Fixs</h4>
            <p>More bug fixes are going live!</p>
            <p>We've identified an issue where joining a server with a large island (40,000+ blocks) could crash the server if not enough memory is available. This results in the large island's data being corrupted (lots of missing blocks). As a temporary fix, we now deny large islands from joining a server if it will cause a crash. This means players with large islands may need to join several different servers until they are able to load-in.</p>
            <p>We're working on ways we can avoid this type of restriction for large islands. For the time being, players with large islands are recommended to either join non-full servers or reserve a VIP server. We've also lowered the max player count to 22. We're hoping this lowered limit is only temporary.</p>

            <h4>Small Update</h4>
<p>Rolling out a small update! Everyone has been asking for us to focus on bugs for a while so we devoted the past few days to it.</p>
<p>🔧 Island Corruption Fixes</p>
<p>We finally reproduced a common bug that caused island corruption. This patch includes a fix for the issue -- we're hoping this drastically cuts down on the amount of island corruptions.</p>
<p>🛡️ Duping Exploit Patches</p>
<p>We were also able to reproduce several dupes and include patches for them. This should help stabilize the economy to make trading better for everyone.</p>
<p>📰 Island Names</p>
<p>You can now set a display name for your published island. This will show up in the online server list. We're excited to see what type of islands start appearing in the popular list!</p>
<p>🔭 Coming Soon</p>
<p>The team is busy working on a new AI framework that will let us finally add animals to the game! We're also working on an overhaul to the inventory UI -- it includes categories and item searching!</p>
<p>We're also looking for more ways to balance the economy. If you have ideas, please share them on <a href="https://skyblock.nolt.io/">https://skyblock.nolt.io/</a></p>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/RobloxIslands/status/1322330712452689920?s=20">Roblox Islands (@RobloxIslands)</a></p>
    <p>New update releasing this Sunday! 🏰🔨🌹🌼</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>October 30, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Game Server Changes</h4>
    <p>Just deployed changes to how our game servers operate. We're still monitoring the changes and are tweaking as needed. A full changelog will be included in Sunday's update.</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Join Codes Feature</h4>
    <p>All players now have join codes! You can share join codes to allow players who aren't your friends to teleport to your server.</p>
    <p>We heard your concerns and are still working on a new invite system... But this should help in the meantime 😊</p>
    <p>Rejoin the game to get access to this new feature. Note: We're still releasing a content update tomorrow morning!</p>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 1, 2020</h3>
    <h4>New Content Update</h4>
    <p>A new content update has been released! @everyone</p>

    <p>🌈 Colors</p>
    <p>New clay block colors have been added! Color your clay blocks using the new flowers! There are now 11 colors in total.</p>

    <p>🌻 Flowers</p>
    <p>We've introduced 5 different flower types with lots of color variants (35+ flowers in total). Flowers can now be crossbred to produce new colors. Only fertile flowers can be crossbred (flowers with particles). Crossbreed flowers by placing fertile flowers near each other and watering them. Collecting all flower and color types will take time and strategy! Watering cans also now have infinite water storage.</p>

    <p>🏰 New Hub</p>
    <p>A new castle hub has been added! The Hub now has up to 50 players per-server too! Because there are more players in the Hub, we've made it so anyone who attacks a mob gets a reward (no more kill steals).</p>

    <p>📡 Server Changes</p>
    <p>Each island now has their own server. This was an important overhaul of our system in order to finally increase the build limit. We're still monitoring the performance for a few days -- if successful, we'll increase the build limit to 150,000 blocks (currently 50,000). You should notice that your island loads much quicker now and has less lag in general.</p>

    <p>🗨️ Cross Server Chat</p>
    <p>We've introduced a new cross-server chat system. This means you can chat with players who aren't on your server. This only applies to public Island servers -- hubs and private servers are still local chat.</p>

    <p>More changes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔨 Double doors</li>
        <li>🔨 Upside down stairs</li>
        <li>🔨 Top and bottom slabs</li>
        <li>🔨 R to rotate while placing</li>
        <li>💾 Hotbar layout saves on rejoin</li>
        <li>💾 Music toggle saves on rejoin</li>
        <li>🛰️ All players now have access to join codes for free</li>
        <li>🏭 Doubled the lifetime and amount limit of factory-dropped items</li>
        <li>👐 All items render properly in your hand (no more weird cubes)</li>
        <li>🎃 Removed Halloween content</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="update-entry">

</div>
<div class="update-entry">
    <h3>November 6, 2020</h3>
    <h4>Invite System Update</h4>
    <p>We just shipped a new update that lets you invite players to your island. You're able to invite friends and players connected to your chat room.</p>
    <p>We wanted to release a working version ASAP since many of you have been requesting it. We'll be incrementing on the entire system throughout the following week to make playing with others as easy as possible.</p>
    <p>Also, we're releasing a new content update tomorrow 🎉</p>
    <p>EDIT: Looks like there are a few issues with the new system. We're working on some fixes.</p>

    <h4>Vending Machine Balancing</h4>
    <p>Vending Machines have become a dangerously effective way to spread duped items and money throughout the game. In an effort to combat this, we're introducing a 10% tax on all Vending Machine transactions. We also took the time to add some QoL features to vending machines.</p>

    <p><strong>New update is live! @everyone</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>💧 Water<br>Water is finally here! Craft empty buckets, fill them up in the Hub lake and place the water on your island. This was a complex system to add into Roblox -- please report any bugs and we'll try to get them fixed ASAP. We will be improving water over time with features like fishing, item floating physics and more!</li>
        <li>🎌 Banner Gamepass<br>With the new Banner Gamepass you can craft over a dozen beautiful banners for your island. Each banner can either be placed on the floor or hung on a wall. There are also 4 free banners that everyone can purchase with coins from John, the Blocks Villager.</li>
        <li>🎨 Texture Improvements<br>We improved a ton of the block textures to be more consistent with the rest of the game. Here's the full list of changed textures:
            <ul>
                <li>Wood planks (all variants)</li>
